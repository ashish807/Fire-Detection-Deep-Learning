# Fire-Detection-Deep-Learning

Main idea of this project is to detect the fire and sent the alert message to the authorities

It can be implemented in live CCTV which will alert the authorites if fire take place.

This was a demo project for Deep Learning.

Demo for how to use [TensorFlow]() to train a model, how to pre-process the data in the Tensorflow

This will surely give you a idea how to work on Tensorflow, if you are a beginner.

If you like this project you can do a lot of improvements like:

1) Convert the RGB color image to HSV color image, because it will help you to detect the fire color easily if you work on HSV image.

2) You can convert images into gray scale if you want to detect smoke too.

3) You can add more layers to this model.

4) If you're familiar with ResNet you can use this one, this will give more accurate result.
